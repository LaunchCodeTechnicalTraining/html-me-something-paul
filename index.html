      <h4>Assignment 3</h4>
         <p>I really disliked assignment #3. It was confusing, and I didn't know what the book was asking us to do. I knew I was supposed to be practicing classes, and unit testing, but I found it difficult to focus on practicing these topics because I spent so much time trying to figure out what I needed to do.</p>
         <p class="frustrating-emphasis">It was frustrating!</p>
      <h4>Assignment 4</h4>
         <p>I'm hoping assignment 4 is a better experience for everyone. It should have us practicing, in a less frustrating fashion, HTML, CSS and some Git.</p>
      <h5>Paul's Disclaimer</h5>
         <p>I've never been very good at HTML, or CSS. I have no design interests/skills, so I usually rely very heavily on 3rd party libraries.</p>
         <p>These 3rd parth CSS libraries have pre-written CSS classes that allow you to easily tap into professionaly designed tools that just look nice, which is something I struggle to do even on my best of days.</p>
